# kysely-schema-validator

ðŸš§ Work in Progress â€“ This project is currently in active development. ðŸš§

A TypeScript library and CLI tool for validating database schemas against Kysely TypeScript types. Supports SQL file parsing, direct DB introspection, and schema drift detection. Easily integrates into CI/CD pipelines or custom applications.

## Planned Features

- Schema Validation â€“ Compare SQL schema definitions with Kysely TypeScript types.
- SQL Parsing & Introspection â€“ Validate against a .sql file or a live database.
- Standard & DB-Specific Support â€“ Start with SQL standard, extend for PostgreSQL.
- Two Integration Modes:
  - CLI Tool â€“ Run schema validation from the command line.
  - Programmatic API â€“ Use a TypeScript function to integrate into custom scripts.
